# Trump-Tweet-Analysis
This repository is for the Unstructured Data Analytics course I pursued as a part of the Masters program in Business Analytics from The University of Texas at Austin, McCombs School of Business.
This project was built by Disha Gandhi, Muskaan Singhania, Nittala Venkata Sai Aditya, Apurva Audi, and Tanvi Dalal.

The goal of this project was to be able to judge if Donald Trump will win the elections in 2024 based on the discussion and trends on social media. We used past tweets of Twitter from old archives using web scraping and then scraped fresh tweets off twitter to look at the current sentiments among the crowd and compared the trends in both the time intervals.

Concepts and Algorithms used over here are based on Unstructured Data and revolves around Natural Language Processing. Some of them are Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling, Text Pre-Processing, Frequency Analysis, Lift Analysis, and MDS.
